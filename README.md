# Pathfinder

This is a React application that displays a visualisation of algorithm pathfinding. This is intended as an academic learning experience to better understand how different algorithms behave.

- As of this commit, only Dijkstra's algorithm is available. I plan to include more options in the future.
- You can click+drag to draw walls on the grid space, serving as obstacles for the algorithm.
